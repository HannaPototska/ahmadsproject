            <p>At first I was afraid, I was petrified
                Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
                But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
                And I grew strong
                And I learned how to get along
                And so you're back
                From outer space
                I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
                I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
                If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me</p>
